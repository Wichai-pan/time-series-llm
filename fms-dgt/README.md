| [Setup](#setup) | [Usage](#usage) |

This is the main repository for DiGiT, our **D**ata **G**eneration and **T**ransformation framework.

## Setup

First clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IBM/fms_dgt.git
cd fms_dgt
```

Now set up your virtual environment. We recommend using a Python virtual environment with Python >=3.10.15 and <3.13.x. Here is how to setup a virtual environment using [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To install packages, we recommend the following

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please install the pre-commit hooks to adhere with code hygiene standards
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> pre-commit install
> ```

For whichever of various API services you plan on using, you need to add configurations to `.env` file. Copy the `.env.example` as `.env` and add your KEYS as follows:

```yaml
# watsonx [Optional]
WATSONX_API_KEY=<WatsonX key goes here>
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=<Project env variable>

# OpenAI [Optional]
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI key goes here>

# Azure OpenAI [Optional]
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<AZURE OPENAI key goes here>

# Antropic [Optional]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<ANTHROPIC key goes here>
```

## Usage

To test whether you have been successful, run the following operation that references a databuilder.

- Using [ollama](https://ollama.com/)

> [!TIP]
> Default settings assumes you have `mistral-small3.2` running. Please use following command to run it for an hour
>
> ```bash
> ollama run mistral-small3.2 --keepalive "1h" &
> ```

```bash
python -m fms_dgt.core --task-paths ./tasks/core/simple/logical_reasoning/causal --restart-generation
```

- Using [IBM watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx)

> [!CAUTION]
> you must set up a `WATSONX_API_KEY` and `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID` before using watsonx API service

```bash
python -m fms_dgt.core --task-paths ./tasks/core/simple/logical_reasoning/causal --restart-generation --config-path configs/core/watsonx_simple.yaml
```

If successful, you should see the outputs of the command in the `./output` directory
